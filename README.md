#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic application that design, develop, test, and maintain software system. It enables Innovation ny creating new applications, products and services that improve lives.
Ensures Reliability to stable software.
Well-engineered software optimizes efficiency and performance of software.
Software engineering principles facilitate the development of scalable software that can grow with increasing demands1.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Emergence as a Profession: In the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, software engineering aligned to computer science and traditional engineering fields.
Role of Women: Early software engineering history featured influential women wheras fewer women work in the software enginering field.
The introduction of structured methodologies and processes transformed software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
In this phase, developers work closely with stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and system requirements inordreto define clear specifications for the software project.
System Design: Architects and designers create a high-level design for the software and  decide on the system’s architecture, components, data flow, and interfaces.
Implementation (Coding):Developers write code based on the design specifications which involves translating the design into actual software components.
Testing and Quality Assurance:Testers verify the software’s functionality, performance, and security. Reports identified,bugs and fixes them.
Deployment and Maintenance:The software is deployed to production environments.Ongoing maintenance, updates, and bug fixes occur during this phase.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a linear project management approach with well-defined stages. Each stage (requirements, design, development, testing) follows the previous one, and there are formal hand-offs while Agile emphasizes flexibility, rapid iteration, and continuous improvement. Work is divided into time-based Sprints, allowing frequent value delivery.
Characteristics of waterfall
Clear milestones and structured planning.
Sequential process: One phase must complete before the next begins.
Best suited for stable, unchanging requirements.
Scenarios:
Building a bridge or physical infrastructure.
Regulatory compliance projects.
Projects with limited customer feedback. 
Characteristics o Agile
Iterative and adaptive.
Self-organizing teams.
Prioritizes customer/user feedback.
Scenarios:
Software development (especially web and mobile apps).
Creative projects with evolving requirements.
Startups or small teams where agility is crucial

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer/Software Engineer.
Role: Software developers are responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software applications.
Responsibilities:
Design and Development: They create software solutions based on requirements, using programming languages and frameworks.
Testing and Debugging: Developers write unit tests, identify and fix bugs, and optimize code.
Collaboration: They work closely with other team members, including designers, product managers, and QA engineers.
Continuous Learning: Developers stay updated on industry trends and best practices.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer /Tester:
Role: QA engineers ensure the quality and reliability of software products.
Responsibilities:
Test Planning: They create test plans, test cases, and test scripts.
Functional and Non-Functional Testing: QA engineers verify that the software meets functional requirements (e.g., features) and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security).
Regression Testing: They ensure that new features don’t break existing functionality.
Reporting and Documentation: QA engineers document defects and provide feedback to developers.
Project Manager:
Role: Project managers oversee the entire software development process.
Responsibilities:
Planning and Coordination: They create project plans, allocate resources, and manage timelines.
Risk Management: Project managers identify and mitigate risks.
Communication: They facilitate communication among team members, stakeholders, and clients.
Budget and Scope Control: Project managers ensure that the project stays within budget and meets the defined scope.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
